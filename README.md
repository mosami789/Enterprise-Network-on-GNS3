üîñ Project Title:
Design and Implementation of a Secure Multi-Branch Banking Network with Redundancy and Advanced Security Features


üìù Project Description:
This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure, scalable, and redundant network infrastructure for a banking environment. The network connects a main office (headquarters) with multiple branch offices, ATMs, and data center facilities using secure and reliable technologies.

The design includes:
Multiple VLANs to separate departments such as HR, IT, Finance, and Guests.
ASA Firewall (NGFW) for traffic inspection, NAT, VPN termination, and access control.
DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, and Port Security to secure Layer 2 switching.
HSRP between multilayer switches to provide gateway redundancy.
IPsec VPN tunnels to connect branch routers with the HQ firewall securely.
Voice VLANs for IP phones with centralized configuration using Option 150 and TFTP.
Syslog, NTP, DNS, AAA, and DHCP servers distributed between DMZ and Data Center zones based on access needs.
Load balancing and redundant Internet connections using dual OUTSIDE interfaces on ASA/FTD with fallback routes.

üéØ Project Goals:
Ensure secure communication between HQ and branch offices.
Prevent unauthorized access and rogue DHCP servers.
Achieve redundancy at core network layers (routing, firewall, switching).
Provide safe public access to services hosted in the DMZ (e.g., web, mail).
Support voice communication and IP telephony infrastructure.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
Cisco ASA 5500-X Series (with NAT, ACLs, VPN)
Cisco ISR Routers (e.g., 4331)
Cisco Layer 3 Switches with HSRP
IPsec Site-to-Site VPN
DHCP Snooping, ARP Inspection, Port Security
GNS3 / Packet Tracer for simulation and testing

üìà Result:
The final network design provides high availability, secure remote access, efficient traffic segmentation, and centralized control. The use of best practices in security and routing ensures that the network is robust, fault-tolerant, and ready for real-world deployment.
